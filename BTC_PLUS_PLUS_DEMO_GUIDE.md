## Demo Script

### Opening
"Good afternoon! I'm excited to show you SatsConnect, a revolutionary Lightning wallet built specifically for African markets. Unlike traditional custodial wallets, SatsConnect gives users complete control over their Bitcoin while providing seamless integration with MPesa for easy fiat on/off ramps."

### Wallet Creation
"Let's start by creating a new wallet. Notice how we generate a secure 12-word mnemonic phrase using cryptographically secure random generation. The mnemonic is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored securely on the device. Users never lose control of their funds."

### MPesa Integration
"Now let's buy some Bitcoin using MPesa. I'll enter 1000 KES, and you can see the real-time exchange rate from multiple sources. The system automatically converts this to satoshis and initiates an MPesa STK Push. Once the payment is confirmed, Bitcoin is instantly credited to the wallet."

### Lightning Payments
"Here's where the magic happens - Lightning Network payments. I'll generate an invoice for 50,000 sats and show you the QR code. Anyone can scan this and send a Lightning payment that settles instantly with minimal fees. This is perfect for micro-payments and daily transactions."

### Airtime Purchase
"Finally, let's convert Bitcoin back to something useful - airtime. I'll select Safaricom, enter a phone number, and purchase 500 KES worth of airtime. The system converts satoshis to KES and processes the airtime purchase through our MPesa integration."

### Technical Highlights
"SatsConnect is built with enterprise-grade security and performance. The Rust backend uses LDK-node for Lightning Network functionality, ensuring reliability and speed. The Node.js orchestrator handles API integration and business logic, while the React Native frontend provides a native mobile experience."
