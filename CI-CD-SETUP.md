## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- Weekly dependency updates for all ecosystems
- Covers Rust (Cargo), Node.js (npm), GitHub Actions, and Docker
- Scheduled for Mondays at 9:00 AM UTC

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MWANGAZA-LAB/SatsConnect.git
cd SatsConnect

# Create the .github directory structure
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### 2. Copy Workflow Files
Copy all the workflow files from this setup to your repository:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
- `.github/workflows/dependabot.yml`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`

### 3. Configure Secrets (Optional)
For enhanced security features, configure these secrets in your repository settings:

```bash
# Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
# Add the following secrets:

TRIVY_TOKEN=your_trivy_token_here  # Optional: for Trivy vulnerability database
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Actions
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Actions > General
3. Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
4. Save the settings

## 🚦 Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: Full CI pipeline runs
- **Pull requests**: Full CI pipeline runs
- **Daily at 2 AM UTC**: Security audit runs
- **Git tags (v*)**: Release pipeline runs

### Manual Triggers
- **CI Pipeline**: Can be triggered manually with environment selection
- **Security Audit**: Can be triggered manually
- **Release Pipeline**: Can be triggered manually with version input

## 📊 Monitoring and Results

### Build Status
- ✅ **Green**: All checks passed
- ❌ **Red**: One or more checks failed
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Build in progress or warnings

### Artifacts Generated
- `rust-engine-binary`: Compiled Rust engine
- `node-orchestrator-dist`: Built Node.js application
- `react-native-bundles`: Mobile app bundles
- `security-scan-results`: Security audit reports

### Coverage Reports
- Code coverage is automatically uploaded to Codecov
- Separate coverage for Rust, Node.js, and React Native
- Coverage thresholds can be configured

## 🔒 Security Features

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Trivy**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and Docker images
- **TruffleHog**: Detects secrets and credentials in code
- **CodeQL**: Analyzes code for security issues

### Dependency Management
- **Cargo Audit**: Rust dependency security scanning
- **npm audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability checks
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates

### Code Quality
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Clippy**: Rust linting and suggestions
- **TypeScript**: Type checking

## 🚀 Deployment

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Trigger manual deployment to staging
gh workflow run ci.yml -f environment=staging
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Create a release tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Or trigger manual release
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=v1.0.0
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Rust**: Cargo registry and target directory caching
- **Node.js**: npm cache and node_modules caching
- **Docker**: Multi-stage build caching

### Parallel Execution
- Jobs run in parallel where possible
- Dependencies are minimized for faster execution
- Artifacts are shared between jobs

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
   - Verify all dependencies are properly configured
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly

2. **Security Scan Failures**
   - Review vulnerability reports in the Security tab
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Check for exposed secrets

3. **Test Failures**
   - Run tests locally to reproduce issues
   - Check test database connections
   - Verify mock configurations

### Getting Help
- Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
- Review the Security tab for vulnerability reports
- Open an issue for persistent problems
